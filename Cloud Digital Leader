Explore Data With Google Cloud
========================================
1.Structured Data- Cloud SQL - MySQL,PLSQL,SQL Server for OLTP in regional scaling Reltaional databases.Cloud SQL is a transactional relational database optimized for both reads and writes used in an operational context, but not for analyzing historical data.
                   Cloud Spanner - Global scaling for Relational database ,OLTP
                   BigQuery - Data warehouse solutions or OLAP, gives storage and Analytics with serverless. in petabytes

2.Semi Structured data - FireStorage - for Semi structured OLTP, document based DB
                         BigTable - for OLAP big data DB.
                
3.UnStructured date - Cloud Storage for object storage

* DMS- Data Migration service  helps to LIFT and SHIFT approach to move from On prem to Cloud
* Data Stream - which syncs all data
* Looker - A BI tool to create visualization of Data
* Pub/sub - Messaging service for distributed apps
* Data flow - gives pipeline for ETL workloads.

GC Solutions for AI and Machine Learning
------------------------------------------
*BigQuery ML - Using Data warehouse solution
*Pre Trained API's- Can use come pre build google API to build ML solutions
  Vision API - detects texts images sentiments in the data
  Data Loss Prevension API- Removes sensitive data 
  Dilogflow- To create chatbot.
*Auto ML- Vertex AI  lets user to build end to end solution withour writing a single line of code
  Unless Audio file are formated to Video AutoML never recognize.
*Custom Training- have to build from end to end.
*Tensarflow Model in Vertex AI like Auto ML which is used by data scientists team and uses Tensar Processing Unit which speeds up to 15x-50x.
Vertex AI- unified AI and ML platform.
Natural Language- Sentiment analysis and Response categorization.




Modernizing Infrastructure and Applications with GC
=======================================================

Workload
Retired - Removing a component
Retained- Intentionally retained
Rehosted(lift&shift) - Migrate to cloud as is
Replatform - Migrate with some changes.
Refactored- Changing architecture or code of the workload.
Reimagined- Reconsidering complete workload.

Compute -
*Virtual Machines
  Compute Engine - IAAS - Can be created using Console or CLI using teraform or Compute Engine API.
  Spot VMs and Preemptible VMs
*Containers
  Virual Machine virtualize and entire machine. whereas Containers virtualize software layers above os level.
  Kubernates- GKE-Complex environment to run
  Cloud Run- Serverless when need scale up and down quickly.
*Serverless
  Function as a service
  Cloud Run
  Cloud Function - same as Lambda
  App Engine- best for multi version testing.

*Apigee - API Management service .
*GKE enterprise support both multicloud and hybrid cloud.
*Bare Metal Soultion - lets organization to run their oracle workloads.



Understanding GC Security and Operations
===========================================

Confidentiality
Integrity
Availabilty

Configuration Mishups-cybersecurity threat occurs when errors arise during the setup of resources, inadvertently exposing sensitive data and systems to unauthorized access      


VPN and Interconnect- to connect on prem to cloud
VPC- Isolated logical section
CLoud Armor - prevents DDOS Attacks.
Security Command Center- Help to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
Cloud Logging - A service to collect and analuze logs

Cost Management Tool - helps to track , analyze and optimize cloud spend.
GC Pricing Calculator - Estimates the price.


Cloud monitoring - provides comprehensive view of cloud infra and apps
Cloud trace - helps to identify performance issues by collecting latency
Cloud Logging- collects all logs.
Cloud profiler - collect CPU usages, memory and give insights how apps are using resources.
Error reporing - Counta and analyze crashes in real time.
