*Cloud Engineer deploys and secure appli,cations and infrastructure, Monitor operations of mutiple projects and maintains enterprise solutions that meets specific metrices.

GC Infra can be broadly divided into:
Compute 
Storage
Bigdata
ML
Application Services

IaaS-Compute Engine
PaaS- App Engine
Serverless - Cloud functions- event driven, Cloud run - Depoly containerized microservice application 
*GCP introduced per second billing-Google cloud pricin calculator to estimate.-Budgets,Alerts,Reports and Quotas to spefiy the limts or control the bills.

*GC Resource Hirarchy-
-Resources-Project-Folder-Organization Node
-Policy applied at higher level will be inherited to lower level
-Project contains - 
Project name-Mutable, not unique, we choose
Project Id - Globally unique, immutable,Googlr choose
number-Globally unique and immutable.
-GC Resource manager tool designed to manager projects programatically.
-Folders can contain projects or folders

*IAM
-Defines WHO can do WHAT on WHICH resources.
-Policy always checks Deny rule over allow rule.
-3 types of roles - 
Basic Role, -Editor , Viewver, Owner, Billing Admin
Predefined role-When we cant to use specific premissions.
Custom Role, - Even more specific.We have to manage.Can be applied only at Project or Organizational Level.

*Service Accounts
-Whenever Compute engine wants to access rather then human we create Service accounts.
-Service accounts use mail id and cryphtograpic keys not passwords.
-Service accounts must be managed.
-IAM policies can be attached to service accounts jus like other resources.

*Cloud Identity
-Using Cloud identity, organizations can define and manage their users and groups using Console.

*VPC-Virtual Private cloud
-A secure,individual,private cloud computing model hosted within public cloud.
-VPC has routing table.

*Compute Engine - 
-Can create and run Virtual machines on GCP.
-Sustained Use discounts - when instnce is is used more then 25% in a month 
-Comitted use discounts-57% discount when workload is comitted for 1 or 3 years.
-preempyible or spot VM
-Autoscling can be used to horizontally scale the compute engine.

*Cloud Load Balancing- Balance the load across the VMs, provides multi region load balancing also.


*Connecting networks to Google VPC
-Cloud VPN -Uses Cloud Router to make connection dynamic.
-Direct Peering - Puts a router in the same public datacenter  as a Google point of presence.
-Carrier Peering - Gives direct access from on prem though service provider network.
-Dedicated Inerconnect - Allows one or more direct, private connections to google
-Partner Interconnect - useful if DC is in a physical location that cant be reached via Dedicated interconnect.
-Cross Cloud interconnect - Connectivity with other service provider.



*Google Cloud Storage Options 
-Structured
-Unstructured
-Transactional
-Relational

*Cloud Storage -(more or less similiar to s3)
-Object storage
-Storage classes
  -Standard Storage-Frequently accessed
  -Nearline Storage - Infrequently accessed like once in a month.
  -Coldline Storage - Once per 90 days.
  -Archival Storage - Once a year.
  -Auto class - Automatically detects the data access patern and categorize.

*Cloud SQL 
-MySQL,Postrges, SQL Server
-Can scale up to 864GB of RAM , 64TB of Storage 

*Cloud Spanner 
-Strongly Consistent  and scales horizontally
-Specially for joins and secondary indexes, High no og reads/ writes, Built in high availablity, Strong global consistency.

*Fire store 
-No SQL DB for mobile ,web.
-Data stored in documents.

*BigTable
-NoSQL Bigdata database service.
-Low latency, high throughput, and handle massive work loads
-great for both operational and analytical applications.
