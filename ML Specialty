1.Data Collection
==========================================

Machine learning cycle
-----------------------------------------
FETCH DATA -> CLEAN -> PREPARE -> Traing Model -> Evaluate Model -> Deploy Production -> Monitor & Evaluate -> FETCH DATA
GENEREATE EXAMPLE DATA -> Deploy The Model
  
*No matter how we get the data , we are building a repository. We must find a way  to congregate the data into 
single data repository.

General Data Terminology
-----------------------------------------
*Datasets - The data we use in machine learning is usually defined as dataset. dataset is collection of data.
*Structured data - which has a deined schema- includes attribute names and thier datatypes.Relational tables 
*Unstructured data - No defined scheme. Images, video audio etc
*Semi structured- To unstructured for relationsal data - CSV, JSON, XML.

Databases -  Databases are repositories for Traditional Relational DBs
Data Warehouse - some processes will takes place before storing 
Data Lake - Stores massive amount of unstructured data.No process before storing.

Machine Learning Terminologies
------------------------------------------
*Labeled Data - Data where we already know where the target data is. Supervised learning
*Unlabeled Data - Data that has been collected with no target attribute. Unsupervised learning

*Categorical features - That are associated with a group. Qualitative, Discrete
*Continuos feature - values that are expressed as measurable number. Quantitative, Infinite

*Text data - 
*Ground truth data - data that has succefully labbeled and can be trusted as truth data.
*Image data - 
*Time series data - data that changes with time.

AWS Data Stores 
----------------------------------------
*S3 -object based storage,  0-5TB single object size , unlimited storage, Go to place for ML data
*RDS - Traditional relational DBs
*DynamoDb- No relational db, key value pair. 
*Redshift- Data warehousing solution. Any kind of data. BI tools can used on warehouse.Redshift spectrume allows to query s3 data.
*Document DB- Mongodb compitible AWS db.
*TimeStream- Time series data - stock market data.



AWS Helper Tools
----------------------------------------
*EMR- Elastic Map Reduce - Its Fully managed hadoop based cluster
*Athena - Serverless paltform that allows to sql queries on s3 data.


Redshift Spectrurm vs Athena 
-----------------------
*Both query on s3
*RS needs Redshift cluster , Athena does not need
*RS is made for existing redshift customers and Athena is for new customers quickly want to query s3 data.
